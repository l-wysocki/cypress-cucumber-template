Feature: duckduckgo.com
  Scenario: visiting the frontpage
    When I visit the URL 'https://duckduckgo.com/'
    Then I should see a search bar
    Then The title is 'DuckDuckGo â€” Privacy, simplified.'
    And The element '.badge-link__subtitle' does not contain any text
    And I verify that the whole website is not visually regressed. Base image: 'base.jpg'. Threshold: 0.01
